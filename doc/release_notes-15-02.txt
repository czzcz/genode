Virtualization on ARM
#####################

The ARMv7 architecture of more recent processors, like Cortex-A7, Cortex-A15, or
Cortex-A17 CPUs, was extended to facilitate virtualization of guest operating
systems. With the current release, we enable the usage of this virtualization
extension in our custom base-hw kernel when running on the Arndale board.

While integrating ARM's virtualization extension, we aimed to strictly follow
microkernel-construction principles. The primary design is geared to the
[http://hypervisor.org/ - NOVA OS Virtualization Architecture]. It grounds on a
micro-hypervisor that provides only basic primitives to switch between virtual
machines (VM) and essential mechanisms like provided by other micro-kernels
too. On top of the micro-hypervisor classical OS services are implemented as
ordinary, unprivileged user applications. Those services can be used by other
applications. Either services are shared between applications, or instantiated
separately, according to the security and safety needs. Correspondingly,
following the NOVA principles every VM has its own associated virtual-machine
monitor (VMM) that run as an unprivileged user application. VMM implementations
can range from simple ones that just emulate primary needed devices to highly
complex monitors including sophisticated device models, like VirtualBox. The
NOVA approach allows to decouple the TCB complexity of one VM with respect to
another, as well as with respect to all applications not related to
virtualization at all.

Along those lines we extended the base-hw kernel/core conglomerate with API
extensions that enable a VMM user application to create and control virtual
machines.

Design
======

The ARM virtualization extensions are based on the so called security
extensions, commonly known as TrustZone. The ARM designers did not follow the
Intel approach to split the CPU into "root" and "guest" world having all prior
existing CPU modes available in both. Instead, they added a new privilege level
to the non-secure side of the TrustZone that sits underneath the ordinary kernel
and userland privilege levels. It is subject to a hypervisor-like kernel. All
instructions used to prepare a VM's environment have to be executed in this so
called "hyp" mode. On the other hand, some instructions do not behave like they
are executed within kernel privilege level. Therefore, prior-existing kernel
code cannot simply be shifted into "hyp" mode without modifications.

The base-hw kernel is meant to run Genode's core process on bare hardware. Thus,
the core process, which is an ordinary application running in userland, was
linked together with a slim kernel library that is executed in privileged kernel
mode. To enable ARM hardware virtualization we broadened this approach to run
the core process in three different privilege levels. Thereby, core shares the
same view on hardware resources and virtual memory across all levels, but it
executes only code pathes in higher privilege-levels that would fail in lower
ones. Following this approach, we could also limit necessary modifications of
existing kernel code.

[image avirt_overview]
  Genode's ARM kernel (core) runs across all privilege levels

The hypervisor part of core is only responsible to switch between VMs and the
host system. Therefore, it needs to load/store additional CPU state that
normally stay untouched during context switches of ordinary tasks. It needs to
configure the VM's guest-physical to host-physical translations. Moreover, the
virtualization extensions of the ARMv7 architecture are not related to the CPU
cores only. The interrupt controller and the CPU core local timers are
virtualization affine too. Therefore, the hypervisor has to load/store specific
state of those devices too. Nevertheless, the hypervisor does reload those
devices only. It does not interpret its state.

In contrast to the low-complexity hypervisor, the user-level VMM can be complex
without putting the system's security at risk. It contains potentially complex
device-emulation code and assigns hardware resources such as memory and
interrupts to the VM. The VMM is an ordinary application running
unprivileged. Of course, as plain user-land application it is not able to
directly access hardware resources. Hence an interface between VMM and the
kernel is needed to share the state of a virtual machine. We faced a similar
problem when building a VMM for our former TrustZone experiments. It was natural
to build upon the available solution, extending it where necessary. Core
provides a so called VM service. Each VM corresponds to a session of this
service. The session provides the following extended interface:

:CPU state:
  The CPU-state function returns a dataspace containing the virtual machine's
  state. It is initially filled by the VMM before starting the VM, gets updated
  by the hypervisor whenever it switches away from the VM, and can be used by
  the VMM to interpret the behavior of the guest OS. Moreover, it can be
  updated after the virtual machine monitor emulated instructions
  for the VM.

:Exception handler:
  The second function is used to register a signal handler that gets informed
  whenever the VM produces a virtualization fault.

:Run:
  The run function starts or resumes the execution of the VM.

:Pause:
  The pause function removes the VM from the kernel's scheduler.

:Attach:
  This function attaches a given dataspace to a designated area of the
  guest-physical address space

:Detach:
  The detach function invalidates a designated area of the guest-physical
  address space

:Attach_pic: Tells the hypervisor to attach the CPU's virtual interface of the
  virtualization-aware interrupt controller to a designated area of the
  guest-physical address space

Implementation
==============

Following strictly the micro-kernel construction primitives when integrating the
hypervisor into the base-hw kernel, we reached a minimal invasive solution. In
doing so, we took the time to separate TrustZone specific code that was inherent
part of the kernel for ARMv7 platforms formerly. Now, TrustZone- and
virtualization-specific aspects are only part of the kernel, where they are
actually used. The change in complexity of the whole core component expressed in
lines-of-code is shown in the table below. As can be seen the additional code in
the root of the Trusted Computing Base when using virtualization is about 700-800
LOC.

  Platform        | with TrustZone, no VT | TrustZone/VT optional
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
  hw_arndale      | 17970 LOC             | 18730 LOC
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  hw_imx53_qsb    | 17900 LOC             | 17760 LOC
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  hw_imx53_qsb_tz | 18260 LOC             | 18320 LOC
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  hw_rpi          | 17500 LOC             | 17430 LOC
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  hw_panda        | 18040 LOC             | 17880 LOC
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
  hw_odroid_xu    | 17980 LOC             | 18050 LOC

Beside the pure VM world switch, the kernel got extended by the so called "large
physical address extension" (LPAE), which is obligatory when using
virtualization. It allows to address 40-bit instead of only 32-bit physical
address spaces. Moreover, to execute in hypervisor mode, the bootstrap code of
the kernel had to be set up properly. Hence, when booting on the Arndale board,
the kernel now prepares the non-secure TrustZone world first, and finally leaves the
secure world forever.

To test and showcase the ARM virtualization features integrated in base-hw, we
implemented a minimal, exemplary VMM. It can be found in
_repos/os/src/server/vmm_. The VMM emulates a simplified variant of ARM's
Versatile Express Cortex A15 development platform. Currently, it only comprises
support for the CPU, timer, interrupt-controller, and a UART device. It is
written in 1100 lines of C++ in addition to the base Genode libraries. The VMM
is able to boot a vanilla Linux kernel compiled with a slightly modified
standard configuration (no-SMP), and a device tree description stripped down to
the devices provided by the VMM. This release include an automated run test that
executes the Linux kernel on top of the VMM on Genode. It can be started via:

! make run/vmm

    log/serial: handle spurious EOF
    
    While booting up, some devices send garbage over the serial connection.
    This can result in an unexpected EOF event within expect(1). A filter
    program may be specified with '--log-serial-filter' to circumvent this
    problem. Then, the output of the serial program is piped through
    the filter, which may sanitize the character stream.
    
    Fixes #1395.


Low-level OS infrastructure
###########################

Improved management of physical memory
======================================

On machines with a lot of memory, there exist constraints with regard to
the physical address ranges of memory:

* On platforms with a non-uniform memory architecture, subsystems should
  preferably use memory that is local to the CPU cores the subsystem is using.
  Otherwise the performance is impeded by costly memory accesses to
  the memory of remote computing nodes.

* Unless an IOMMU is used, device drivers use to program physical addresses
  into device registers to perform DMA operations. Legacy devices such as
  USB UHCI controllers expect a 32-bit address. Consequently, the memory
  used as DMA buffers for those devices must not be allocated above 4 GiB.

* When using an IOMMU on NOVA, Genode represents the address space
  accessible by devices (by the means of DMA) using a so-called device PD.
  ([http://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/13.02#DMA_protection_via_IOMMU])
  All DMA buffers are identity mapped with their physical addresses within
  the device PD. Because the device PD is a regular component, the upper 1 GiB
  of its virtual address space is preserved for the kernel. Consequently,
  no memory objects can be attached to this area, which constraints the
  physical address range to be used for the DMA buffers to the lower 3 GiB.

Up to now, Genode components had no way to influence the allocation of
memory with respect to physical address ranges. To solve the problems outlined
above, we extended core's RAM services to take allocation constraints
as session arguments when a RAM session is created. All dataspaces created
via such a session are subjected to the specified constraints. In particular,
this change enables the AHCI/PCI driver to allocate DMA buffers at suitable
physical address ranges.

This innocent looking feature to constrain RAM allocations raises a problem
though: If an arbitrary component was able to constrain RAM allocations in
arbitrary ways, is would become able to scan the physical address space for
allocated memory by successively opening RAM sessions with the constraints set
to an individual page and observe whether an allocation succeeds or not. Two
conspiring components could use this information to construct a covert storage
channel.

To prevent such an abuse, the init component filters out allocations
constrains from RAM-session requests unless explicitly permitted. The
permission is granted by supplementing the RAM resource assignment of
a component with the new 'constrain_phys' attribute. For example:

! <resource name="RAM" quantum="3M" constrain_phys="yes"/>


Init component
==============

Most of Genode's example scenarios in the form of run scripts support
different platforms. However, as the platform details vary, the run scripts
have to tweak the configuration of the init component according to the
features of the platform.
For example, when declaring an explicit route to a framebuffer driver named
"fb_drv", the run script won't work on Linux because on this platform, the
framebuffer driver is called "fb_sdl".
Another example is the role of the USB driver. Depending on the platform, the
USB driver is an input driver, a block driver, a networking driver, or a
combination of those.
Consequently, run scripts with support
for a great variety of platforms tend to become convoluted with
platform-specific conditionals.

To counter this problem, we enhanced init to support aliases for component
names. By defining the following aliases in the init configuration
! <alias name="nic_drv"   child="usb_drv"/>
! <alias name="input_drv" child="usb_drv"/>
! <alias name="block_drv" child="usb_drv"/>
the USB driver becomes reachable by sessions routed to either "usb_drv",
"nic_drv", "input_drv", and "block_drv". Consequently, the routing
configuration of components that use either of those drivers does no longer
depend on any platform-intrinsic knowledge.


RTC session interface

    os: structured timestamp in Rtc session
    
    Instead of returning an uint64_t value, return a structured time stamp.
    This change is only visible to components using Rtc_session directly.
    
    Fixes #1381.



Update of rump-kernel-based file systems
========================================

We updated the rump-kernel support to a newer rump-kernel version (mid of
January). This way, Genode is able to profit from the upstream stability
improvements related to the memory management. Furthermore, we revised the
Genode backend to allow the rump_fs server to cope well with a large amount of
memory assigned to it. The latter is useful to utilize the block cache of the
NetBSD kernel.

    tz_vmm: support USB-Armory board
    
    For the USB-Armory, we use a newer version of Linux (3.18) as for the
    i.MX53-QSB. The main difference is, that the newer Linux uses a DTB instead of
    ATAGs.
    
    Fixes #1422

    hw: support USB-Armory board
    
    The USB Armory is almost the same as the i.MX53-QSB but it uses only
    one of the two RAM banks available in i.MX53. Furthermore we use the USB
    Armory only with Trustzone enabled.

IPC helping

    hw: helping on IPC
    
    On base-hw, each thread owns exactly one scheduling context for its
    whole lifetime. However, introducing helping on IPC, a thread might get
    executed on scheduling contexts that it doesn't own. Figuratively
    spoken, the IPC-helping relation spans trees between threads. These
    trees are identical to those of the IPC relation between threads. The
    root of such a tree is executed on all scheduling contexts in the tree.
    All other threads in the tree are not executed on any scheduling context
    as long as they remain in this position. Consequently, the ready-state
    of all scheduling contexts in an IPC-helping tree always equals the
    state of the root context.

    hw vea9x4: remove trustzone support
    
    When building Genode for VEA9X4 as micro-hypervisor protected by the ARM
    TrustZone hardware we ran into limitations regarding our basic daily
    testing routines. The most significant is that, when speaking about RAM
    partitioning, the only available options are to configure the whole SRAM
    to be secure and the whole DDR-RAM to be non-secure or vice versa. The
    SRAM however provides only 32 MB which isn't enough for both a
    representative non-secure guest OS or a secure Genode that is still
    capable of passing our basic tests. This initiated our decision to
    remove the VEA9X4 TrustZone-support.
    
    Fixes #1351

Tools for convenient handling of port contrib dirs
==================================================

We supplemented our tools for the ports mechanism with two convenient
scripts:

:_tool/ports/shortcut_:

  Creates a symbolic link from _contrib/<port-name>-<hash>_ to
  _contrib/<port-name>_. This is useful when working on the third-party
  code contained in the _contrib_ directory.

:_tool/ports/current_:

  Prints the current contrib directory of port. When switching
  branches back and forth, the hash of the used port might change.
  The script provides a shortcut to looking up the hash file for a
  specific port within the repositories and printing its content.
